# Solvation

Calculation of solvation entropy according to 

J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2019, 15, 5, 3204â€“3214

If you utilize this code in please cite the above reference. 

The input file must define the following
mandatory arguments:
 solute = (xyz file for solute molecule)
 solvent = (xyz file for solvent molecule)
 omega = (Pitzer acentric factor of solvent)
 rho_solvent = (density of solvent in g/mL)

The following arguments are optional:
 freq_file = (a file with the vibrational frequencies in Gaussian format)
 linear = (True/False; whether the molecule is linear; default = False )
 symmetry = (rotational symmetry number of solute; default = 1)
 vol_solute = (Solute volume in A^3)
 area_solute = (Surface area of solute in A^2)
 vol_solvent = (Solvent volume in A^3)
 area_solvent = (Surface area of solvent in A^2)
 dipole_solute = (dipole moment of solute in Debye)
 dipole_solvent = (dipole moment of solvent in Debye)
 temperature = (temperature in Kelvin; default = 298.15)
 concentration = (concentration in mol/L of solute; default = 1M)
 nu0 = (low frequency threshold in cm^-1; default = 100 cm^-1)

Notes:
 - The format requires each variable to be specified in a separate
   line in the input file.
 - Providing the solute volume and surface area can save substantial
   computation time.
