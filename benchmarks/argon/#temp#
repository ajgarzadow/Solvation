The entropies of molecules in solution are routinely 
	calculated using gas phase formulae. It is assumed that, 
	because solvation models have been fitted to reproduce 
	free energies, 
	this is sufficient for modeling reactions in solution. 
	However, this procedure severely underestimates 
	$\Delta S$ 
	in reactions that generate adducts and adsorption
	 processes. 	
	Here, two alternative, inexpensive methods to compute molecular
	entropies 
	in solution are proposed to address this issue.
	%and can accurately reproduce experimental entropies. 
	The methods, denoted $S_\omega$ and $S_\text{SPT}$,
	 do not use any empirical parameters, but only 
	basic solvent properties. $S_\omega$ utilizes a molecular 
	property (the Pitzer acentric factor), while $S_\text{SPT}$ uses a 
	macroscopic property (the 
	thermal expansion coefficient); 
	a connection between these two properties is thus  
	established.  
	A database of 105 experimental solvation entropies 
	is constructed to test the methods; 
	both $S_\omega$ and $S_\text{SPT}$ provide average 
	errors in the range of chemical accuracy 
	($\approx$ 2--3 cal/mol-K or $<$ 1 kcal/mol at 300 K).
	These results  imply that solvation models that 
	can describe $\Delta H_\text{sol}$ and $\Delta S_\text{sol}$  separately and
	accurately can be developed by combining
	$S_\omega$ or $S_\text{SPT}$  with
	existing  (reparametrized) models.
